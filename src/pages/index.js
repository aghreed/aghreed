          I'm a software developer based in Brooklyn, New York by way of Omaha, Nebraska and Manhattan, Kansas. I'm passionate about building intuitive and useful applications that focus on human experiences. I like using technology purposefully, not just for technology's sake.

        <h2>Professional</h2>
        <p>
        Throughout my six years working in the field, I've had the opportunity to create custom software in the startup, commercial and government domains. I value trust, quality communication, and a collaborative and supportive work environment. I believe in people over process and
        enjoy working closely with clients to best understand their needs. Even more, I enjoy working closely with co-workers to deliver quality, tested software solutions specifically tailored for the needs of the client. I've worked with talented collaborators to successfully
        deliver projects spanning a number of industries including insurance, finance, logistics, and communications

        <h2>Side</h2>
        <p>
           For me, side work is not just about doing a favor for a friend or pursuing a passion project. Itâ€™s about meeting people, making new connections and challenging myself. I care deeply about the collaborative nature of technology, which is why you'll often find me at meetups, conferences, and workshops around the country. I love an excuse to experiment with a technology I'm unfamiliar with as much as I enjoy sharing something I'm well-versed in.
